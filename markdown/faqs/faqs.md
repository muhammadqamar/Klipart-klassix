  ### \*\*What are Klipart Klassix NFTs?\*\*


  They are a collection of 850, non-generative art NFTs on Solana. Non-generative means that they are all composited by hand rather than by a computer algorithm.


  In total there are around 100 recreated classic pieces of art, with between 3-9 variants of each piece. We want to take classical art – and give it an NFT inspired makeover.


  ### \*\*Who is the artist behind Klipart Klassix?\*\*


  Each piece was hand-drawn by our resident artist Woof Original ([@WoofOriginal](https://www.instagram.com/wooforiginal)) . He is a graffiti artist by trade, starting out by tagging trains and painting murals in the streets of London’s East End, before now travelling around the world and making art his full time profession. This launch will be Woof Original’s first NFT collection.


  ### \*\*What happens if someone collects a full collection?\*\*


  A collection constitutes the original artwork and all of its variants. For those who manage to collect a full collection in a single wallet before the end of June 2022, Woof Original will hand paint a personalised version of the artwork and send it to you in real life. His recent collections sold at galleries have fetched between $2-10k.


  ### \*\*When is the launch?\*\*


  \*Tentatively\* February 25th assuming artwork is finalised by then.


  ### \*\*How much will mint price be?\*\*


  Mint price is currently planned to be 0.5 SOL, to be confirmed prior to launch.


  ### \*\*How do I get one?\*\*


  The majority of the mint will be via a whitelist, and limited to 2-per-wallet. This is in an effort to prevent the inevitable botting. Any NFTs not sold during whitelist will then be sold during a public sale shortly after the Whitelist period ends.


  ### \*\*How do I get whitelisted?\*\*


  There's a number of different ways to get whitelisted, including but not limited to:


  * \- Discord OGs.

  * \- Discord giveaways.

  * \- Twitter giveaways.

  * \- Extraordinary contributions to the community
