            They are a collection of 850, non-generative art NFTs on Solana.
            Non-generative means that they are all composited by hand rather
            than by a computer algorithm.
          </p>
          <p className="my-2">
            In total there are around 100 recreated classic pieces of art, with
            between 3-9 variants of each piece. We want to take classical art –
            and give it an NFT inspired makeover.

        </h3>
        <div className="mt-2">
          <p className="my-2">
            Each piece was hand-drawn by our resident artist Woof Original
            (@WoofOriginal). He is a graffiti artist by trade, starting out by
            tagging trains and painting murals in the streets of London’s East
            End, before now travelling around the world and making art his full
            time profession. This launch will be Woof Original’s first NFT
            collection.

          **What happens if someone collects a full collection?**
        </h3>
        <div className="mt-2">
          <p className="my-2">
            A collection constitutes the original artwork and all of its
            variants. For those who manage to collect a full collection in a
            single wallet before the end of June 2022, Woof Original will hand
            paint a personalised version of the artwork and send it to you in
            real life. His recent collections sold at galleries have fetched
            between $2-10k.

        <div className="mt-2">
          <p className="my-2">
            The majority of the mint will be via a whitelist, and limited to
            2-per-wallet. This is in an effort to prevent the inevitable
            botting. Any NFTs not sold during whitelist will then be sold during
            a public sale shortly after the Whitelist period ends.
